    "Important note:"
    " image denoising must be performed as the first step of the image processing pipeline."
    " The routine will not operate correctly if interpolation or smoothing"
    " has been applied to the data prior to denoising.";

    "Note that this function does not correct for non-Gaussian noise biases"
    " present in magnitude-reconstructed MRI images."
    " If available, including the MRI phase data as part of a complex input image"
    " can reduce such non-Gaussian biases.";

    " Singular Value Decomposition (BDCSVD) algorithm"
    " for deriving the eigenspectrum for each PCA patch."
    " This is more numerically precise than the Self-Adjoint solver used"
    " in the original MRtrix3 dwidenoise command;"
    " it does however come at increased computational expense,"
    " particularly for very large patches."
    " If runtime is prohibitive for data with a very large number of volumes,"
    " it may be preferred to revert to the original decomposition method"
    " using command-line option -decomposition selfajoint.";

const char *filter_description =
    "By default, optimal value shrinkage based on minimisation of the Frobenius norm "
    "will be used to attenuate eigenvectors based on the estimated noise level. "
    "Hard truncation of sub-threshold components and inclusion of supra-threshold components"
    "---which was the behaviour of the dwidenoise command in version 3.0.x---"
    "can be activated using -filter truncate."
    "Alternatively, optimal truncation as described in Gavish and Donoho 2014 "
    "can be utilised by specifying -filter optthresh. "
    "For denoising of functional MRI data, "
    "it is hypothesized (though not exhaustively tested) "
    "that use of -filter truncate may be a superior choice to the default optimal shrinkage "
    "as it minimises risk of loss of BOLD signal fluctuations near the noise floor.";

const char *aggregation_description =
    "-aggregation exclusive corresponds to the behaviour of the dwidenoise command in version 3.0.x, "
    "where the output intensities for a given image voxel are determined exclusively "
    "from the PCA decomposition where the sliding spatial window is centred at that voxel. "
    "In all other use cases, so-called \"overcomplete local PCA\" is performed, "
    "where the intensities for an output image voxel are some combination of all PCA decompositions "
    "for which that voxel is included in the local spatial kernel. "
    "There are multiple algebraic forms that modulate the weight with which each decomposition "
    "contributes with greater or lesser strength toward the output image intensities. "
    "The various options are: "
    "'gaussian': A Gaussian distribution with FWHM equal to twice the voxel size, "
    "such that decompisitions centred more closely to the output voxel have greater influence; "
    "'invl0': The inverse of the L0 norm (ie. rank) of each decomposition, "
    "as used in Manjon et al. 2013; "
    "'rank': The rank of each decomposition, "
    "such that high-rank decompositions contribute more strongly to the output intensities "
    "regardless of distance between the output voxel and the centre of the decomposition kernel; "
    "'uniform': All decompositions that include the output voxel in the sliding spatial window contribute equally.";
